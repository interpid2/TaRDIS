TaRDIS task manager

Idea was born using Win10 as an OS. When it starts downloading updates, it uses all available bandwidth for it and showing only internal bandwidth used in percentage. While in list of processes, you can't see at the same time which process is using most of the cpu, ram and network usage.

Made in C# using Windows Preformance Monitor Counters and openHardwareMonitor dll. While program development is still in progress, final idea of the project is for users with multiple screens to have all necessary informations in compact view while running some other app in full screen. Running programs would be sorted differently in 3 separated lists:
- sorted by CPU usage
- sorted by RAM usage
- sorted by network usage

IDE used is Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Visual Studio can be found on link: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/.
